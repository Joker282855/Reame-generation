  # Title: Animal Rescue
  
  # Description
  I was watching a televison one day about dogs that were rescued after being abandoned by their owners. This gave me the idea to come up with an applicaiton that the police can use to track the owners of the people who aboandoned their animals so that they can face the consequences of their actions. 
  I was motivated because I grew up with two dogs and tow cats. These animals are my best friends and I do not want any animal to be living on their own without an owner to take care of them. Another thing that motivated me to do this project was that people who abandon there animals should be brought to justice
  It matters to me because I beleive that owners have a responsiblity that they need to fulfill. Every pet deserve an owner who cares for them and will take of them
