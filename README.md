  # Title: Dog Rescue
  
  # Description
  I was conducting some research and saw that the number of dogs who are abondoned by their owners has started to increase
  My motiation for this project comes from wantng to give dogs who are abandoned a place to live and not be left on the street. I grew up with dogs and think that all dogs derserve a good home
  This project matters to me because I enjoy seeing other peoples reactions when they see a dog that they recently bought for the first time. Another reason why this matters to me is because dogs are used to help others who have special needs and need a special companion
