  # Title: Animal Protection
  
  # Description
  I spent some time doing research on saving animals from the street who had been abaondoned by their owners. The research led me to conclude that this is a serious issue around the world and that these animals need loving homes so they do not have to live on the street anymore. I simply want to raise public awareness of the harsh reality animals face when they get abaondoned by their owners. 
  As mentioned before I want to raise public awareness that animals who have been abondoned on the street need to find a loving home with a loving family. Having an animal as a pet can birng joy into a persons life and provides them with companionship if they are lonely.
  I have a dog of my own who has helped me get through hard times and has become very important to me over the years. It would break my heart to see my beloved animal living on the streets with no one to take care of it something happened to me. I feel that every pet deserves to have a roof over their head and make the public aware that this is a problem that needs to be fixed.
